As per [Risk Assessment Guidance and Risk Profiles](/risk-assessment-guidance-and-risk-profiles.pdf) published December 16, 2024 relevant for forum community operators.

**Complete a Risk Assessment:**

*   **Four-Step Process:**
    1.  **Understand:** 
        *   Identify all **17 categories of priority illegal content** and understand the **definitions and legal boundaries** of each.
        *   **Research non-priority illegal content** relevant to your service and user base (e.g., local laws, community standards).
        *   Thoroughly examine Ofcom's Risk Profiles and the **Register of Risks**, identifying all relevant risk factors and understanding the nuances of how they apply to your specific service.
        *   For U2U services, **map out user journeys and potential misuse scenarios** to identify how the service could be used to commit or facilitate priority offenses.
    2.  **Assess**:
        *   **Gather evidence**: Actively seek out user reports, complaints, and data on content and behavior. If necessary, **conduct surveys or user interviews** to gain deeper insights.
        *   **Analyze likelihood**: For each type of illegal content, evaluate the probability of it appearing or being facilitated on your service based on the identified risk factors and evidence. Consider **historical trends, user demographics, and technological vulnerabilities**.
        *   **Analyze impact**: Assess the potential severity of harm for each type of illegal content, considering the **vulnerability of users, potential reach and virality of content, and psychological or physical consequences**.
        *   **Evaluate existing controls**: Scrutinize current safety measures and moderation practices, **assessing their effectiveness** in detecting, preventing, and mitigating illegal content and behaviors.
        *   **Assign risk levels**: Using Ofcom's Risk Level Tables and your evidence-based analysis, assign a risk level (negligible, low, medium, high) to each category of illegal content, **justifying each decision with specific evidence and reasoning**.
    3.  **Decide and Implement**:
        *   **Consult Ofcom's Codes of Practice**: Carefully review the recommended measures for your service's risk profile and **create a detailed implementation plan**.
        *   **Consider alternative measures**: If appropriate, explore alternative safety measures that may be more effective or tailored to your service, ensuring they **meet or exceed Ofcom's requirements**.
        *   **Implement and document**: Put the chosen safety measures into place, documenting the **rationale, implementation process, and expected outcomes**.
    4.  **Report, Review, Update**:
        *   **Establish reporting channels**: Create clear procedures for **internal reporting and escalation of illegal content risks** and safety issues.
        *   **Monitor and measure**: Continuously track the effectiveness of safety measures using **qualitative and quantitative metrics**. Regularly review user reports and content trends to identify emerging risks.
        *   **Schedule regular reviews**: Set a **calendar reminder for annual risk assessment reviews**. Conduct more frequent reviews if significant changes are made to the service or if Ofcom updates its Risk Profiles.
        *   **Document reviews and updates**: Maintain a **detailed log of all risk assessment reviews**, including changes made, evidence considered, and rationale for decisions.

**Record Keeping**: 

*   Create a **centralized and secure system** for storing risk assessment records.
*   Ensure records are **detailed, clear, and easily accessible** to relevant personnel and Ofcom.
*   **Regularly audit** record-keeping practices to ensure compliance.

**Categorized Service Providers**:

*   **Prepare and publish a clear and concise summary** of your risk assessment, highlighting key findings and safety measures.
*   **Promptly submit a copy of your risk assessment record to Ofcom** upon completion or revision.

**Review and Update**:

*   **Stay informed**: Actively monitor Ofcom's announcements and updates to Risk Profiles.
*   **Proactively assess the impact** of any service changes or external developments on your risk profile.
*   **Implement a robust change management process** that includes risk assessment reviews for significant service modifications.
